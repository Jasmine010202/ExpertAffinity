His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,
Being your slave, what should I do but tend
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
And by their verdict is determined
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.
O, that our night of woe might have remember'd
