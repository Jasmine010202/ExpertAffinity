That every word doth almost tell my name,
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
And so the general of hot desire
Others but stewards of their excellence.
And in abundance addeth to his store;
A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both
FROM fairest creatures we desire increase,
Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;
To hideous winter and confounds him there;
Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
O, that our night of woe might have remember'd
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
