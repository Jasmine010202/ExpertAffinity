Who all their parts of me to thee did give;
Then will I swear beauty herself is black
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
To linger out a purposed overthrow.
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
Either not assail'd or victor being charged;
But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!
Like him that travels I return again,
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
